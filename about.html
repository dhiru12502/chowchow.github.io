    Mysterious people, matter, places etc. have always fascinated people of all corner of the globe. The search for truth in the “incomprehensible” has led to many controversies. Some believe in the “supernatural”, while others simply do not. Both types of people obviously have their own reasoning’s for believing or disbelieving in it. This world is full of mysteries, some of them are controversial and remain “unsolved” to this day. Some of these mysteries include the Loch Ness Monster, the Abominable Snowman, and the Bermuda Triangle.

The story about the Loch Ness Monster is that it is a legendary animal that supposedly resides in the depths of Loch Ness, a long narrow lake situated in rural Scotland. The region was in complete isolation until a road was built alongside the lake in 1933. Then large numbers of people travelled through the region for the very first time. Over the years thousands have reported seeing something in the lake. Most reports depict a long neck surging from the water with a small head of a unknown creature. Pictures have even been taken of this “creature”, but most scientists however; refuse to believe any creature of this kind lives in the Loch Ness. They claim that most reported cases are simply products of over-active imaginations, and as for the pictures, scientists say they are not lucid enough to distinguish items clearly, and some pictures are dubbed as “fake”. A large number of non- scientists believe however, that the Loch Ness is the site of a breeding colony of large unknown aquatic animals, due to the fact that Loch Ness was once an arm of the sea. Yearly summer investigations have been conducted since 1963 in attempt to unravel the mystery. Investigators have obtained films and sonar readings that indicate that there just might be some unknown animal in the depths of the Loch Ness. Evidence however, is inconclusive, and the controversy continues. Along with the Loch Ness Monster, the Abominable Snowman shares fame as one of the great mysteries of the world. The Abominable Snowman is a legendary creature of the Himalayas mountain region. It is reported to live in frosted regions near the snow line. This mysterious creature is also known to by the name Yeti. The Abominable Snowman is said to walk upright and have the appearance of half-man, half-ape. Many of the descriptions given to this creature are based upon the findings of large, unidentified footprints in the snow, found in the Himalayas. In order to ascertain the truth behind the Abominable Snowman legends, countless expeditions have been undertaken, and most turned up empty. Today most experts hold the view that the “Abominable Snowman” is simply a “fairy tale” and don’t take the matter seriously. Mostly the Sherpa, a tribe of people living in the Himalayas, has kept the legend of the Abominable Snowman alive ’till this day. These people have always kept the belief that the abominable snowman is a true fact of life. To them he is seen as a religious figure, to be feared as well as protected. Without any concise evidence however, no one can prove this legendary animal from the mountains exists, so the mystery continues to baffle. Like the Loch Ness Monster and the Abominable Snowman, the Bermuda Triangle presents another, intriguing wonder to the world. The Bermuda Triangle, also known as the Devil’s triangle, is a triangular area of the Atlantic Ocean (305,000 km2) where the disappearances of ships, aeroplanes, and boats has led to the belief that “supernatural” forces inhabit this area of the sea. More than 200 planes, ships, and boats are believed to have disappeared in this triangle without a trace. In most of these disappearances, it is the fact that no distress signal was ever received from the disappearing ships and/or planes that heightens the mystery of what happened to them. Although violent storms and downward air currents frequently occur in the area, scientists have not revealed anything extremely peculiar. Boundaries of the Bermuda Triangle are formed by drawing an imaginary line from Melbourne, Florida, to Bermuda, to Puerto Rico, and back to Florida. Could there truly be an unnatural force at work in this geographical triangle or are these disappearances merely coincidence? Either way, numerous people remain unwilling to step over the boundary line into the Devil’s Triangle. As we have just discussed the mystery of the Loch Ness Monster, the conundrum of the Abominable Snowman, and the enigma of the Bermuda Triangle, we must realise that they are only a few of the many world famous “unsolved” mysteries. From them however, we observe that it can be extremely difficult to ascertain the truth of unexplainable phenomena due to the many opposing opinions in this field.

Will we ever come up with a definite conclusion or truth, when it comes to mysteries? The future remains to answer this question, and we humans remain intrigued, and confused about what to believe.
