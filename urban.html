      <li><b>Slender Man-</b>
      </li>
      <div>
        Meet the most infamous urban legend of the Internet era. Created by Something Awful user Eric Knudsen under the fictional name Victor Surge, this long-limbed, faceless man supposedly appears in photographs with young children right before they go missing, never to return again. The story, largely due to its vagueness, has simply exploded, with outsize influence and impact.<br><br>

      <li><b>The Expressionless-</b>
      </li>
      <div>
        "In June 1972, a woman appeared in Cedar Sinai [sic] hospital in nothing but a white, blood-covered gown," this urban legend begins.

As the story goes, the woman scared everyone she came in contact with, not because of her blood-smeared garments, but because "she resembled something close to a mannequin." As you might imagine, things didn't go well for the innocents who crossed paths with the so-called "Expressionless"—and if you're curious to finish the fable for yourself, you can read it in full <a href="https://creepypasta.fandom.com/wiki/The_Expressionless">here.</a><br><br>

      <li><b>Jeff the Killer</b>
      </li>
      <div>
        The legend of Jeff the Killer first emerged in 2008 when a YouTuber used a creepy image of a featureless, stark white face in a slideshow of spooky images.

Soon after, a Jeff the Killer backstory started to circulate in which a badly bullied boy named Jeffrey Woods mutilated his own face and got revenge on his tormenters, often whispering the phrase "just go to sleep" as he inflicted cruel punishment on those who wronged him. Yikes!<br><br>

      <li><b>Robert the Doll</b>
      </li>
      <div>
        The only thing that makes the widely-circulated online tale of <a href="https://www.kwahs.org/exhibitions/robert-the-doll">Rober the doll </a> creepier is the fact that it's based on a real doll. Evidently, the toy that the story is based off of was the property of a young Floridian resident named Robert Eugene Otto, or Gene, back in the early 1900s—and during that time, it has been said that Gene would often speak about Robert as if he were a living, breathing creature capable of making his own mischief.Even after Otto died in 1974, residents of Key West continued to experience unexplainable encounters with Robert—he'd allegedly make faces, giggle, and move objects around the room. Currently, the potentially possessed doll is housed at the Key West Art & Historical Society, and paranormal enthusiasts are constantly making the trek to Florida just to visit the hollow boy.<br><br>

      </div>
      <li><b>The Black-Eyed Children</b>
      </li>
      <div>
        The first story to ever circulate about the black-eyed children—spooky, dead-eyed kids who menacingly stare at adults and try to get invited into homes and cars to commit acts of mass murder—was a supposed eyewitness account written by a journalist named Brian Bethel.According to Bethel, during his travels in Abilene, Texas, two children with "coal black" eyes had approached his car and asked for a ride home—but when he started to show fear, the older of the two boys started shouting, "WE CAN'T COME IN UNLESS YOU TELL US IT'S OK," and Bethel got out of there before it was too late.To this day, Bethel insists that his interaction with the black-eyed children actually happened—a claim he's repeated on TV and in a local Abilene paper—but people are more than hesitant to believe in these creepy children.While the black-eyed children have been around for decades, it wasn't until the internet that stories about them became as commonplace as your average bogeyman. Since these children are so well-known in the creepypasta community, Reddit and 4Chan users love to use them as antagonists in some of their most dreadful scary stories.<br><br>

      <li><b>Elevator Incident</b>
      </li>
      <div>
        In "Elevator Incident," a businessperson describes a past trip to Taiwan during which he experienced some frightening paranormal activity. While visiting a building with just five floors—1, 2, 3, 5, and 6—the author steps out of the elevator only to find himself on a dark abandoned floor where someone—or something—is residing. Upon further investigation, the narrator finds out that he had somehow ended up on the 4th floor—even though it had been boarded up decades ago after a deadly incident left people spooked.<br><br>

      </div>
      <li><b>Kuchisake-onna</b>
      </li>
      <div>
        uchisake-onna is a rather disturbing legend surrounding a seemingly ordinary woman wearing a surgical mask, as though to protect others from catching her cold. She appears before those walking alone at night, usually children, and asks, ‘Am I beautiful?’ If you answer no, you are killed with the pair of scissors Kuchisake-onna carries. If you answer yes, she takes off her mask to reveal her grotesque grin, a mouth that has been slit from ear to ear. ‘How about now?’ she will ask; she will kill you if you say no, and cut you an identical smile if you say yes. Rumor has it that a few answers will confuse Kuchisake-onna long enough for you to escape: ‘You’re average,’ or, ‘Meh, so-so’. According to myth, Kuchisake-onna was a woman disfigured by her husband when he found out she was cheating. After he viciously cut her mouth, he asked her, ‘Who will think you are beautiful now?’ This is popular urban legend in Japan, and appears in dozens of movies, manga and anime.<br><br>
